# 1. Selecting the network dataset







# 2. Loading the dataset as a network object





# 3. Show the information of the network dataset



## Show the variables by group

## Show all the platforms



## Show the wells per platform



## Show wells enabled and disabled



# 4. Plot the network

 Will show a plot where 

* the platforms are vertical bars, 
* the A/L type
* wells by completion


* ​

# 5. Working with the Solver dataframe



## Some basic statistics

- High oil producers
- Wells with the highest gas lift injection rates
- Wells with the highest watercut
- Well with the highest GOR

* Plotting relationships
* ​



# 6. Gas Lift KPIs



## Formulas

##  

## Creating a dataframe for the GL KPIs



## Explain the columns





## Plot the variables



## Histograms and density distribution





## Comparing variables and searching for relationships





## Plot GLIR vs Oil Rate and effect of watercut





## Other relationships of GLIR
